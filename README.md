## Description

Vykhod Sily Recordings are pleased to bring you the 3rd release of our Sonic journey. VS003 has been crafted in collaboration by two understated breakbeat heavyweights; Ahmad and Akinsa. With previous collaborative releases on Rupture and Renegade Hardware, in addition to exceptional solo back-catalogues, we are delighted to welcome them to the Vykhod SIly family.
This two-track EP is laden with instinctively sinister undertones, pulsating basslines and primal grooves driven by two ton kick drums.

Kali immediately sets the tone of the EP with eerie sci-fi soundscapes building tension before rolling out into a thundering assault of breaks, as a haunting cry looms above and an intermittent bassline distorts below.

Monolith harks back to rave and breakbeat culture with menacing mentasms and pitched down bleeps, preceded by off beat hi-hats and industrial fx, emanating in a dark side percussive work out fraught with trepidation and paranoia.
